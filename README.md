These are the codes for our projects in the ACMS60852 (Time Series Analysis) course. We conducted a time series analysis of the Seoul Bike Demand dataset.

Dataset Source: Kaggle: Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

After performing exploratory data analysis, we utilized two time series models and one neural network for prediction tasks:

1. SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
2. SARIMAX (SARIMA with eXogenous variables)
3. RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
